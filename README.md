# TV-Show-Manager
TV Show Reminders is the Android mobile application project.

Appcompat 7 is a Android library. TV Show Manager needs to be linked up to this Android project once its imported as a separate project.

Once its imported, please right click onto the TV Show Manager project and select properties. Then click on Android tab to add the Appcompat V7 to the project.

The application is mainly designed for tablets especially the Nexus 7. I've created large and small layout folders to cover different resolutions but the appearance looks better on a tablet.
